    "### Hierarchical clustering:\n",
    "- Clustering approach in which cluster boundaries are nested to each other, creating a parent/child relationship.\n",
    "- This nested structure between clusters creates a hierarchy, that is often represented in the form of a cluster tree, known as dendogram\n",
    "\n",
    "### Partitional Clustering:\n",
    "- Each cluster boundary is independent of the others. There is no hierarchy between clusters. Dividing data objects into non overlapping groups.\n",
    "- No object can be a member of more than one cluster, and each cluster have at least one object\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overlaping Clustering\n",
    "- Approach in which the boundary of one cluster can overlap that of another. Each object of the dataset can be member of one or more clusters. \n",
    "- There is no parent-child relationship here, the boundaries of the child not always are in the boundaries of the parent\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fuzzy/soft clustering\n",
    "- the membership of an item to a particulary cluster, is based on a membership weight that goes between 0 and 1. The larger the weight, the greater the item belongs to a particular cluster.\n",
    "- If the weight is 0, the item absolutely does not belong to the cluster. If the weight is 1, then the item absolutely belong to the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Density based clustering\n",
    "- Determine cluster assignments based on the density of data points in a region\n",
    "- Clusters are assign where there are high densities of data points separated by low density regions"
